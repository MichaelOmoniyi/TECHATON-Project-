## My process
I started with the structuring of the mobile view before structuring the desktop view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt another use of css flexbox

```css
.container_info3 {
  background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
  width: 100%;/*rgba(255,182,193, 0.1)  /*hsl(330%, 100%, 52%); /*hsl(351, 100%, 55%);*/
  /*#ffb6c1*/
  display: flex;
  padding: 1rem 0rem;
  margin-top: 1rem;
  border-radius: 10px;
  justify-content: center;
}
```
### Continued development

I'd love to master the use of flexbox better
