## Overview
In summary, I have been able to create an order summary card based on the design given to us by our Frontend mentor.

### The challenge
To build out an order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
1. I looked through the designs to start planning out how to tackle the project. 
2. Before adding any styles, I structured my content with HTML. 
3. I wrote out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. I started adding styles to the top of the page and work down. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to use the display element, background-image element, border-radius element, align element, justify element, width and height element, padding element, comment tool and the gap element.
These are some of the code snippets below:

```css
body{
 /* background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);*/
  background-image: url('/images/pattern-background-mobile.svg');
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: none;
}
.container_box1{
  border-top-left-radius: 20px;
  border-top-right-radius: 20px;
}
.container {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  text-align: center;
  justify-content: center;
  margin: 10% 5%;
}
.container_info2{
  gap: 1em;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  padding: 0em 0em 2em 0em;
}
```

### Continued development
I would like to master the use of the margin, padding, justify, align, and display elements.
